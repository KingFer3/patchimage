  is in /home/test/TMSFE you were previously required to set the cpk path to

  in case a build failed in batch-mode, the next one can be tried without issues

  The madness begins, feel free to test this out. downloaded
  karts are prefixed mkwiimm_kart_ to avoid naming collision
  with fonts and items (3-chars.szs naming-scheme)
  .
  Original files are backed-up in ${PATCHIMAGE_RIIVOLUTION_DIR}/ \
  ${GAME}_SZS/ - for example /home/chris/Hacks/RMCP27_SZS/ and
  restored every time when you change your selection on the same
  game.
  .
  Your choices are saved into ${HOME}/.patchimage.choice, if
  you want to modify another MKWiimm with the same settings,
  simply enter y when the script asks you whether you want to
  apply your previous settings, else enter n for new choices.
  .
  No dummys were harmed during the making of this feature

  of the MKWiimm patcher with it's own version of the tools.
  .
  This is useful when the supplied ones don't work with your system's
  libpng (usually this happens on non-recent Debian GNU/Linux).
  .
  If creating anything newer than RMCP26 (2015 versions) the tools will
  be never overriden (for now, does not work yet).

v5.0.1:
- fix bug in mario kart wiimm items (did not properly work)

  customization of a game

  (your item choices are saved and can be re-used, so if you want
  to modifiy more than one Mario Kart you only have to choose the

- support RVLution Wii (a NewSMB Mod)

  (as we now symlink the old images rather than copying)
- mkwiimm support. Download and build any Mario Kart Wiimm distribution
  and patch it to use Wiimms custom server (thus patching process takes
  longer as there are two steps now). The old patchers will all work,
  because the outdated versions of the provided tools will be overriden.
- new patchimage.rc options:
	MKWIIMM_GAME_LANG	either de (german) or en (english)
		mkwiimm game language
	MKWIIMM_MSG_LANG	either de, de+ (german) or en, en+ (english)
		mkwiimm message language. de+ and en+ also change all
		other languages to german or english
	MKWIIMM_SHARE_SAVE	either 1=ja (yes) or 2=nein (no)
		whether to share save with the original game

  further user interactions with the wiimm patcher is needed.

  kart is not yet complete

  check the directory for RMC??? images (.iso and .wbfs), create a copy
  of your image for the patcher, let Wiimm's patcher do it's work, move
  the new image to ${PATCHIMAGE_GAME_DIR}.
  .
